# Credit-Union-on-Blockchain---A-new-financial-Cooperative-system-based-Permissioned-Blockchain

Everyone needs help at one point or another. The same is true for financial help, for this reason most people rely on loans to satisfy their financial needs. “Loans to Private Sector in the United States averaged 619.94 USD Billion from 1950 until 2020, reaching an all time high of 2364.08 USD Billion in August of 2019 and a record low of 13.65 USD Billion in January of 1950”Trading Economics, To satisfy this growing demand of loan, banks and Credit Union offer financial services such as saving accounts, loans and the possibility of transferring money one to another. This project focuses on developing a web blockchain application which allows individuals  to create or join a group where they will be able to save money, borrow to/from one another, while keeping track of every transaction without a third party. We will build a digital web application with a database built on permissioned blockchain using smart contracts. “Permissioned blockchain restricts the actors who can contribute to the consensus of the system state. … secure the interactions among a group of entities that have a common goal but which do not fully trust each other, such as businesses that exchange funds (finance), goods (supply chain), or information (public service). By relying on the identities of the peers, a permissioned blockchain can use traditional Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT), RAFT, or Paxos consensus.”Guo, C., Ma, S., Wang, H., Cheng, S., & Wang, basing our web application database on permissioned blockchain gives the security, transparency and transability to the loan system.
