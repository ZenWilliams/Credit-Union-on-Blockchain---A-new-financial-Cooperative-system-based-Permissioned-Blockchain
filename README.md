# Credit-Union-on-Blockchain---A-new-financial-Cooperative-system-based-Permissioned-Blockchain

Current financial cooperative institutions have a system that operates on a centralized network, thus bringing many problems to meet the needs of our generation. These problems are numerous to name; we cite few; the fragility of the system in the face of cyber attack due to its centralized character, the not transparency of the data to all the members of the policy does not describe the cooperative nature of the institutions proper, we can quote from it again and again without stopping. To solve these problems, our research project ground on a network system designed from blockchain technology based on a smart contract, precisely of permissioned blockchain using the hyperledger fabric framework. From the work of Hao Wang, Chaonian Guo, Shuhan Cheng about a new financial loan management system based on smart contracts as the case study. Through the study of the private blockchain algorithm, we will discover the secure nature of this new type of network as well as its transparency to all members having access to it, and we can connect a decentralized network to a more centralized network.
